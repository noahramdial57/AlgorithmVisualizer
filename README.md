# AlgorithmVisualizer
Hi, welcome to my Algorithm Visualizer! The concept behind this project is to give you a behind the scenes look at how these algorithms work. But wait, why should we even care about these algorithms. Let's say you wanted to sort a list of names by alphabetical order, a sorting algorithm would be a good way to go about this problem. Let's say you wanted to find the shortest path from your home to the nearest grocery store, you would use a pathfinding algorithm via Google/Apple maps. The point is these algorithms have become an integral part of our lives and most folks don't even know what they are using it in there everyday lives.

I hope you enjoy using this application and learn something new about how some of these algoritms work!
Check out the application [here.](https://noahramdial57.github.io/AlgorithmVisualizer/).
